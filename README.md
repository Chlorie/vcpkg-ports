# vcpkg-ports

Chlorie's custom vcpkg ports.

## Usage

Please don't use this. I'll update this properly after vcpkg supports registries officially.

~~Enable `registries` feature flag in vcpkg and write a `vcpkg-configuration.json` file like this in your project's root directory, and you're good to go.~~

# vcpkg-ports

Chlorie's custom vcpkg ports.

## Usage

~~Enable `registries` feature flag in vcpkg and write a `vcpkg-configuration.json` file like this in your project's root directory, and you're good to go.~~ vcpkg does not support this at present, clone this repo and use directory registry instead.
